# WOW
This is the Github repo for the code that I wrote over the course of my WOW attachment. 
## QuickRecognition.ipynb
QuickRecognition.ipynb is meant to run on Google Colab, and can be customised for detection using any dataset.
## COCODatasetRecog.py
COCODatasetRecog.py uses the COCO-17 dataset for object recognition.
