# WOW
This GitHub repo contains the programs and other required files that I have used to complete my WOW project. This markdown file will provide a brief description of the code files.

## OldVersion (Folder)
Contains the code for the original robot motion algorithm that used a single shot to detect and move to objects. No longer in use.

## robot.py
The up-to-date code file that makes use of classes, functions and variables from the urx library and wowclasses.py
